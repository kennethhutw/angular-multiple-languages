angular-multiple-languages
================
This is a very simple module to localize strings in an Angular page.

It is based on this code: https://github.com/pasx/angular-i18n

The main difference is that the localization service is a module separate from the application module. My goal was to complete the example because original project did not include angular.min.js and bootstrap.min.js.

##Usage

To localize your application you only need to proceed as follows:

- Add the file i18n.js to your solution and reference it.
- Reference the i18n module in your application module: app = angular.module('app', ['i18n']);
- Create the i18n folder and add the translation files.
- Set JSON as MIME type in web.config (this can also be configured in IIS) :
    <system.webServer>  
        <staticContent>
          <mimeMap fileExtension=".json" mimeType="application/json" />
    </staticContent>
    </system.webServer>

The default language is initialized to en in i18n.js you can change it to fr to see the difference by editing this line:
   i18nService.initialize($rootScope,'en');
to
   i18nService.initialize($rootScope,'fr');

##Evolution

Add a language switch function calling initialize on the service with a combo in the UI.


Directory structure (you will need to add the lib folder and its content):

index.html
-js
  app.js
  i18n.js
-i18n
  i18n_en.json
  i18n_fr.json
  i18n_cn.json
  i18n_tw.json
-css
  styles.css
